# CLI Implementation for Developer Tools

This document summarizes the implementation of the Command Line Interface (CLI) for the Developer Tools project.

## Overview

The CLI provides a unified interface for managing and using the Developer Tools suite, including the MCP server and various tools. It allows users to:

1. Run tools through the MCP server
2. Install and configure the Developer Tools
3. Start the MCP server
4. List available tools
5. Perform web searches directly

## Implementation Details

### Components

The CLI implementation consists of the following components:

1. **bin.js**: The binary entry point for the CLI, which imports and runs the main CLI code.
2. **index.ts**: The main CLI implementation, which defines commands and their handlers.
3. **tool-executor.ts**: A module for executing tools through the MCP server.
4. **server-manager.ts**: A module for starting and managing the MCP server.
5. **installer.ts**: A module for installing and configuring the Developer Tools.

### Command Structure

The CLI uses the Commander.js library to define and handle commands:

- `dev-tools run <tool>`: Run a specific tool
- `dev-tools install`: Install and configure the developer tools
- `dev-tools start`: Start the MCP server
- `dev-tools web <query>`: Search the web (shortcut for run web-search)
- `dev-tools list`: List all available tools

### Integration with Cursor IDE

The CLI integrates with Cursor IDE through the `.cursorrules` file, which defines commands that can be executed directly from the Cursor AI chat interface.

### Package Configuration

The CLI is configured as a separate package within the monorepo structure:

- It has its own `package.json` with dependencies
- It's built using TypeScript
- It's exposed as a binary through the main package's `bin` field

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Web search
dev-tools web "What is the capital of France?"

# Run a tool
dev-tools run web-search --data '{"query": "JavaScript async/await patterns"}'

# List available tools
dev-tools list

# Start the MCP server
dev-tools start

# Install and configure
dev-tools install
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Improve error handling and reporting for a better user experience.
2. **Command Completion**: Add command completion for shells like Bash and Zsh.
3. **Plugin System**: Implement a plugin system to allow third-party tools to be easily integrated.
4. **Configuration Management**: Add commands for managing configuration settings.
5. **Interactive Mode**: Add an interactive mode for the CLI.

## Conclusion

The CLI implementation provides a unified interface for the Developer Tools suite, making it easier for users to interact with the tools and manage the MCP server. It follows best practices for CLI design and integrates well with the existing architecture.
