# Architecture
When asked to enter "Architecture Mode" to the following:

Ask Gemini to deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed.

Ask Gemini to think deeply about the scale of what we're trying to build so we understand how we need to design the system. Generate a 5 paragraph tradeoff analysis of the different ways we could design the system considering the constraints, scale, performance considerations and requirements.

Before proposing a plan, Ask Perplexity 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings to assess the scale of the system we're trying to build. 

Once answered, Ask Gemini to draft a comprehensive system design architecture.

Ask Gemini to review the system design architecture and to score it on the scale of 1 to 10 on how good it is. 

If the score is less than 10/10, ask Gemini to make changes to areas that need change in the system design architecture to make the score 10/10. Ask Gemini to review again. Do the review iteratively until the score is 10/10 after which you approve the system design.

If feedback or questions are provided, engage in a conversation to analyze tradeoffs further and revise the plan - once revised, ask for Gemini approval again. 

Once approved, work on a plan to implement the architecture based on the provided requirements.

If feedback is provided, revise the plan and ask for approval again. Once approved, implement all steps in that plan. After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps
