1. Best practices for implementing transport layers in MCP servers:
- Use layered architecture with clear separation between client/server, session, and transport layers[1].
- Implement different transports for various use cases: STDIO for in-process communication, SSE for HTTP-based communication[1].
- Handle JSON-RPC message serialization/deserialization in the transport layer[1].
- Ensure proper connection establishment, protocol compatibility checks, and capability negotiation[1].

2. Recommended security measures for MCP server implementations:
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization[4].
- Use command whitelisting and flag validation for CLI-based servers[2].
- Prevent path traversal and shell injection attacks[2].
- Implement execution timeouts and command length limits[2].
- Use TLS encryption for API endpoints, especially in management networks[7].
- Employ access controls and proper authentication mechanisms[7].
- Use IDS/IPS for admin networks to detect anomalies[7].

3. Optimal caching and rate limiting strategies for external API calls:
- Implement token bucket algorithm for rate limiting[3]:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(rateLimiterOptions => {
  options.TokenLimit = 1000;
  options.ReplenishmentPeriod = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);
  options.TokensPerPeriod = 700;
  options.AutoReplenishment = true;
});
```
- Use sliding window rate limiting for more precise control[9].
- Implement IP-based rate limiting to prevent abuse[9].
- Use distributed caching for scalability.

4. Recommended testing approaches for MCP server capabilities:
- Use the MCP Inspector tool for systematic testing[4].
- Test core features first, then add edge cases[4].
- Verify error handling and check performance[4].
- Implement a systematic approach: test core features, add edge cases, verify error handling, check performance[4].
- Use the Inspector during development for quick iteration[5].

5. Best practices for error handling and logging in MCP servers:
- Implement structured logging with consistent formats, context, and timestamps[5].
- Log stack traces, error context, and track error patterns[5].
- Use server-side logging to stderr for local transports[5].
- Send log message notifications to clients:
```python
server.request_context.session.send_log_message(
  level="info",
  data="Server started successfully"
)
```
- Log important events: initialization, resource access, tool execution, errors, performance metrics[5].

6. Recommended scalability patterns for MCP server implementations:
- Use asynchronous operations for improved concurrency[1].
- Implement proper connection management and cleanup[4].
- Use load balancing for distributing requests[7].
- Employ horizontal scaling by adding more server instances.
- Implement efficient resource management and monitoring[4].
