## Guidelines for Future Documentation

To maintain consistent documentation across the monorepo:

1. **Package READMEs**: Each package and tool should have its own README.md file that explains:
   - Purpose and features
   - Installation and configuration
   - Usage examples
   - API documentation
   - Testing and development

2. **Architecture Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation on the overall architecture and how packages interact.

3. **Code Comments**: Ensure all public APIs have JSDoc comments.

4. **Changelog**: Keep the CHANGELOG.md file updated with all significant changes.

5. **Examples**: Provide examples for common use cases in the examples/ directory.

## Future Documentation Work

1. **API Documentation**: Generate API documentation for all packages.

2. **Tutorials**: Create step-by-step tutorials for common workflows.

3. **Integration Guides**: Document how to integrate the tools with various environments.

4. **Contributing Guide**: Create a guide for new contributors.

5. **Design Decisions**: Document key architectural and design decisions.

## Conclusion

The documentation has been updated to reflect the new monorepo architecture. These changes should help developers understand the new structure and how to use the various tools and packages. Regular maintenance of documentation should be prioritized as the project evolves.
