Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: 1. What are the specific security best practices for MCP servers? 2. How should versioning and backwards compatibility be handled? 3. What are the recommended approaches for scaling MCP servers? 4. How should the server handle state management and session persistence?
1. Security best practices for MCP servers:
- Use TLS for remote connections[1]
- Implement authentication when needed[1]
- Validate all incoming messages[1]
- Sanitize inputs[1]
- Check message size limits[1]
- Implement access controls[1]
- Monitor resource usage[1]
- Rate limit requests[1]
- Don't leak sensitive information in errors[1]
- Log security-relevant events[1]

2. Versioning and backwards compatibility:
- Use package specifiers to version services (e.g. greet.v1.Greeter)[7]
- Host multiple versions side-by-side[7]
- Strive for backwards compatibility with old clients[7]
- Make breaking changes in new versions[7]

3. Scaling MCP servers:
- Use horizontal scaling by adding more instances[3]
- Implement autoscaling to dynamically adjust capacity[3]
- Create scale units that can be added together[3]
- Set scaling limits to prevent over-scaling[3]
- Use meaningful load metrics as scaling triggers[3]
- Add a buffer to handle unexpected spikes[3]

4. State management and session persistence:
- Use session state for short-lived, user-specific data[4][9]
- Store critical data in databases, not session[4]
- Set appropriate session timeouts[4]
- Use cookies to maintain session IDs[4]
- Consider alternatives like caching for better scalability[4][9]
- Avoid relying on session state for critical application functionality[4]
