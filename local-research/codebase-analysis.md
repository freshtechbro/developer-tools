Okay, let's analyze the implementation of the MCP server and its tools, along with the dependencies.

**1. MCP Server Implementation (`src/server.ts`)**

The `src/server.ts` file serves as the entry point for the MCP server and sets up the core server functionalities. Here's a breakdown of its implementation:

*   **Server Initialization:**
    *   It imports the `Server` class from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js` and `StdioServerTransport` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js`.
    *   It initializes a `Server` instance with metadata like `name`, `version`, and `description` from the `config` module.
    *   The `capabilities` option in the `Server` constructor is used to register resources and tools. Currently, it registers `web-search` and `repo-analysis` tools.
*   **Transport Layer:**
    *   It uses `StdioServerTransport` for communication. This transport is suitable for local execution and testing, as it uses standard input and output streams.
    *   The server connects to the transport using `server.connect(transport)`.
*   **Tool Registration:**
    *   The `capabilities.tools` object is used to register the `webSearchTool` and `repoAnalysisTool`. The keys (`'web-search'`, `'repo-analysis'`) are the tool names that clients will use to invoke these tools.
    *   A `health-check` tool is also registered, demonstrating a simple built-in tool for server status monitoring.
*   **Request Handling:**
    *   The server uses `setRequestHandler` to define how to handle incoming requests. It specifically handles requests matching the `ToolExecuteRequestSchema`.
    *   The `ToolExecuteRequestSchema` is defined using `zod` for schema validation, ensuring that incoming requests for tool execution adhere to a specific structure (`method`, `params` including `toolName`, `version`, and `arguments`).
    *   Inside the request handler, it retrieves the `toolName` from the request parameters and looks up the corresponding tool from the `tools` record.
    *   It then executes the `tool.execute(args)` function, passing the arguments from the request. The result of the tool's execution is returned as part of the response.
*   **Error Handling and Process Management:**
    *   **Uncaught Exceptions and Rejections:** The server sets up handlers for `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` to log errors and terminate the process in case of unexpected errors. This is crucial for server stability.
    *   **Process Termination Signals:** Handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals are set up to gracefully shut down the server upon receiving these signals.
    *   **Startup Error Handling:** The `main` function uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential startup errors and log them before exiting.
*   **Logging:**
    *   The server uses a `logger` module (likely a custom logger as seen in `src/utils/logger.ts`) for logging informational messages, debug messages, and errors. This is essential for monitoring and debugging the server's operation.
*   **Configuration Validation:**
    *   The server validates the configuration using `ServerConfigSchema.parse(config)` from the `config/index.ts` module. This ensures that the server is started with a valid configuration.

**Overall Implementation of MCP Server:**

The server implementation is well-structured and follows good practices:

*   **Modularity:**  It separates the core server logic from the tool implementations.
*   **Schema Validation:**  Uses `zod` for schema validation of requests and responses, ensuring data integrity and type safety.
*   **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling is implemented at multiple levels (request handling, startup, process termination).
*   **Logging:**  Comprehensive logging is integrated for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Configuration:**  Configuration is managed through a dedicated module and validated using schemas.
*   **MCP SDK Usage:** Correctly utilizes the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for server setup and transport management.

**2. Tool Implementations**

Let's analyze the implementations of the `web-search` and `repo-analysis` tools.

**2.1. `web-search` Tool (`src/capabilities/tools/web-search.ts`)**

*   **Purpose:** This tool enables web searching using the Perplexity AI API.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Takes a `query` string as input. Optionally, it can also take a `saveToFile` boolean flag.
    *   Uses `axios` to make HTTP requests to the Perplexity AI API (`PERPLEXITY_API_URL`).
    *   Authenticates with the Perplexity API using an API key (`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`) loaded from environment variables via `dotenv`.
    *   Handles different environments (`test`, `production`, etc.) using `config.env`. In the `test` environment, if the API key is not provided, it returns mock results.
    *   Parses the API response to extract the search results from `response.data.choices[0].message.content`.
    *   If `saveToFile` is true, it saves the search results to a markdown file in the `local-research` directory.
    *   Implements error handling for API requests, including specific handling for Axios errors, API key issues (401, 403), and rate limits (429).
    *   Uses `zod` for request (`WebSearchRequestSchema`) and response (`WebSearchResponseSchema`) schema validation, ensuring that the tool receives and returns data in the expected format.
    *   Logs operations using the `logger` module, including search queries, API calls, saving to file, and errors.
*   **Request and Response Schemas:**
    *   `WebSearchRequestSchema`: Defines the expected structure for the tool's request, including `query` (required string) and `saveToFile` (optional boolean).
    *   `WebSearchResponseSchema`: Defines the structure of the tool's response, including `searchResults` (string) and `savedToFile` (optional string, path to saved file).

**2.2. `repo-analysis` Tool (`src/capabilities/tools/repo-analysis.ts`)**

*   **Purpose:** This tool analyzes code and documentation within a repository using Google Gemini.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Takes a `query` (analysis question), `analysisType` (code, documentation, or both), `targetPath` (optional path to analyze within the repo), and `maxDepth` (directory depth for analysis) as input.
    *   Retrieves repository content using the `getRepositoryContent` function, which recursively reads files up to a specified depth.
    *   Uses `axios` to interact with the Google Gemini API.
    *   Authenticates with the Gemini API using an API key (`config.googleApiKey`).
    *   Caches analysis results in memory (`analysisCache`) to avoid redundant API calls for the same queries within a TTL (Time To Live) period.
    *   Constructs a detailed prompt for the Gemini API, including the query, analysis type, and retrieved repository content.
    *   Attempts to parse and structure the Gemini API response, though the parsing logic is noted as "TODO" in the code, currently returning a simplified structured response with a main analysis and placeholders for code and documentation insights.
    *   Implements error handling for file system operations (`fs.stat`, `fs.readdir`, `fs.readFile`) and Gemini API calls.
    *   Uses `zod` for request (`repoAnalysisRequestSchema`) and response (`repoAnalysisResponseSchema`) schema validation.
    *   Logs operations using the `logger` module, including API calls, cache usage, and errors.
*   **Request and Response Schemas:**
    *   `repoAnalysisRequestSchema`: Defines the request structure, including `query`, `analysisType`, `targetPath`, and `maxDepth`.
    *   `repoAnalysisResponseSchema`: Defines the response structure, including `analysis` (main analysis text), `codeInsights` (optional structured code insights), and `documentationInsights` (optional structured documentation insights).
*   **`getRepositoryContent` Function:**
    *   Recursively traverses a directory structure up to `maxDepth`.
    *   Reads file contents and adds them to a list of strings, prefixed with "File: <filepath>".
    *   Skips directories starting with `.` and `node_modules`.
    *   Includes basic error handling for file system operations.
*   **`analyzeWithGemini` Function:**
    *   Constructs a prompt for the Gemini API based on the query, analysis type, and repository content.
    *   Makes a POST request to the Gemini API endpoint using `axios`.
    *   Handles potential errors during API calls, including Axios errors.
    *   Returns a `GeminiAnalysis` interface object, currently with a simplified structure.

**Overall Tool Implementation:**

Both `web-search` and `repo-analysis` tools demonstrate good implementation practices:

*   **Schema Validation:**  Use `zod` for robust input and output validation.
*   **API Integration:** Properly integrate with external APIs (Perplexity and Gemini) using `axios`.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling for API calls, file system operations, and validation errors.
*   **Configuration Management:**  Utilize `config` module to access API keys and environment settings.
*   **Logging:**  Employ `logger` for detailed logging of tool operations and errors.
*   **Caching (`repo-analysis`):** Implement a caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce API calls for repository analysis.
*   **Modularity:** Tools are implemented as separate modules, making the codebase organized and maintainable.
