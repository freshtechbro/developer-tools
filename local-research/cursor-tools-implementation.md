Packing repository using repomix...
Querying Gemini AI using gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21...
Here's how we can implement the web search, repo search, and browser automation features from `cursor-tools` in our MCP server, along with dependencies, APIs, and server structure considerations:

**1. Feature Implementation in MCP Server:**

*   **Web Search (`cursor-tools web`)**
    *   **MCP Tool:** Implement this as an MCP tool, let's name it `web-search`.
    *   **Capability:**  It will have an `execute` capability.
    *   **Request Schema:**  The request schema for `execute` will include a `query` parameter (string) for the search term.
    *   **Response Schema:** The response schema will include a `results` parameter (string, or potentially a more structured object) containing the search results. We can initially return plain text results and later enhance it to markdown or a structured format.
    *   **Implementation Logic:** Inside the `execute` handler for the `web-search` tool:
        1.  Take the `query` from the request.
        2.  Use the Perplexity AI API to perform the web search.
        3.  Format the results into the response schema.
        4.  Return the response.

*   **Repository Context Search (`cursor-tools repo`)**
    *   **MCP Tool:** Implement this as an MCP tool, let's name it `repo-query` or `repository-context-query`.
    *   **Capability:** It will have an `execute` capability.
    *   **Request Schema:** The request schema for `execute` will include a `query` parameter (string) for the question about the repository.
    *   **Response Schema:** The response schema will include an `answer` parameter (string) containing the context-aware answer.
    *   **Implementation Logic:** Inside the `execute` handler for the `repo-query` tool:
        1.  Take the `query` from the request.
        2.  **Repository Context Acquisition:** This is the most complex part.  We need to figure out how to get the "repository context."  For a basic implementation, we might initially skip deep repository context and just use Gemini for general code-related questions.  For more advanced context:
            *   **Option 1 (Simplified):**  Assume the MCP server is running within a repository directory.  The "context" is the files within that directory. We could potentially feed the contents of all files in the repository to Gemini for context. This is computationally expensive and might have token limits.
            *   **Option 2 (More realistic, but complex):**  Implement repository indexing. This would involve:
                *   Parsing code files in the repository.
                *   Creating an index of code elements (functions, classes, variables, comments, etc.).
                *   Using this index to provide context to Gemini based on the user's query.  This would likely require a vector database or similar technology for efficient semantic search within the code index.
                *   For now, let's focus on the simplified approach (Option 1) or even just general code questions without *specific* repo context.
        3.  Use the Google Gemini API, providing the user's `query` and the acquired repository context (or just the query for the simplified version).
        4.  Format Gemini's response into the `answer` parameter in the response schema.
        5.  Return the response.

*   **Browser Automation (`cursor-tools browser ...`)**
    *   **MCP Tool Suite:** Implement a suite of MCP tools, mirroring the `cursor-tools browser` commands: `browser-open`, `browser-act`, `browser-observe`, `browser-extract`.
    *   **Capabilities:** Each tool will have an `execute` capability.
    *   **Request Schemas:**
        *   `browser-open/execute`:  Request schema will include `url` (string) and options like `html`, `console`, `network`, `screenshot`, `timeout`, `viewport`, `headless`.
        *   `browser-act/execute`, `browser-observe/execute`, `browser-extract/execute`: Request schema will include `url` (string), `instruction` (string), and options like `html`, `console`, `network`, `screenshot`, `timeout`, `viewport`, `headless`.
    *   **Response Schemas:** The response schemas will depend on the command and options chosen. They could include:
        *   `htmlContent` (string): Page HTML.
        *   `consoleLogs` (array of strings): Browser console logs.
        *   `networkActivity` (object or array): Network request/response data.
        *   `screenshotPath` (string): Path to the saved screenshot.
        *   `extractedData` (object or array): Extracted data from the page.
    *   **Implementation Logic:**  For each browser tool's `execute` handler:
        1.  Take the `url`, `instruction` (if applicable), and options from the request.
        2.  Use Playwright to:
            *   Launch a new browser instance (stateless, as in `cursor-tools`).
            *   Navigate to the `url`.
            *   Perform actions based on the `instruction` (for `act`), observe elements (for `observe`), or extract data (for `extract`).
            *   Capture HTML, console logs, network activity, screenshot as requested by options.
        3.  Format the output (HTML, logs, data, etc.) into the response schema.
        4.  Close the browser instance.
        5.  Return the response.

**2. Key Dependencies and APIs:**

*   **Web Search (`web-search` tool):**
    *   **Dependency:**  An HTTP client library for Node.js (like `node-fetch` or `axios`).
    *   **API:** Perplexity AI API. You'll need an API key from Perplexity AI.

*   **Repository Context Search (`repo-query` tool):**
    *   **Dependency:** An HTTP client library.
    *   **API:** Google Gemini API. You'll need a Google Cloud API key with access to the Gemini API.
    *   **Optional (for advanced context):** Libraries for code parsing and indexing (language-specific parsers, vector database like Pinecone or Weaviate).  Initially, we can skip this complexity.

*   **Browser Automation (`browser-*` tools):**
    *   **Dependency:** `playwright` npm package.  This is essential for browser automation.

*   **MCP Server Core:**
    *   **Dependency:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (Node.js SDK) - already included in the plan.

**3. Server Structure for Efficient Request Handling:**

To structure the server effectively, we should use a modular approach as outlined in the `mcp-plan.md`.  Here's a suggested structure:

*   **`server.js` (or `index.js`):**
    *   Main server entry point.
    *   Initializes the MCP `Server` instance.
    *   Sets up the `stdio` (and potentially HTTP/SSE) transport.
    *   Registers all resource and tool providers.
    *   Starts the server.

*   **`capabilities/` directory:**
    *   **`resources/` directory (initially empty or for future resources):**  Place resource provider modules here if we decide to implement any MCP resources in the future.  For now, we are focusing on tools.
    *   **`tools/` directory:**
        *   **`web-search.js`:** Module containing the implementation for the `web-search` tool (including the `execute` handler and Perplexity API interaction).
        *   **`repo-query.js`:** Module for the `repo-query` tool (including the `execute` handler and Gemini API interaction, and repository context logic).
        *   **`browser-automation/` directory:**
            *   **`browser-open.js`:** Module for the `browser-open` tool.
            *   **`browser-act.js`:** Module for the `browser-act` tool.
            *   **`browser-observe.js`:** Module for the `browser-observe` tool.
            *   **`browser-extract.js`:** Module for the `browser-extract` tool.
            *   **(Potentially) `browser-utils.js`:**  A utility module for shared Playwright browser setup and teardown logic across browser tools.

*   **`schemas/` directory:**
    *   Define JSON schemas for all requests and responses for resources and tools.  For example:
        *   `web-search-request.json`
        *   `web-search-response.json`
        *   `repo-query-request.json`
        *   `repo-query-response.json`
        *   `browser-open-request.json`
        *   `browser-open-response.json`
        *   ... and so on for other browser tools.

*   **`config/` directory (optional):**
    *   `config.js` or `.env` file to store API keys (Perplexity, Gemini), and other server configuration.  Use environment variables for API keys for security.

**Request Handling Efficiency:**

*   **Asynchronous Operations:** All API calls (Perplexity, Gemini, Playwright) are asynchronous. Use `async/await` throughout the handlers to ensure non-blocking operations. This is crucial for server responsiveness.
*   **Stateless Tool Implementations:** The browser automation tools are designed to be stateless, which simplifies concurrency. Each tool execution starts a new browser instance and closes it.  This inherently helps with handling concurrent requests.
*   **Modular Design:** The modular structure makes it easier to manage and maintain the code, and to potentially optimize individual tool implementations without affecting others.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in each tool handler. Return MCP-compliant error responses to the client. Log errors for debugging.
*   **Resource Management (Playwright):**  Be mindful of Playwright browser instance management, especially if there are many concurrent browser automation requests.  While statelessness helps, consider resource limits if needed in a high-load scenario.

**Simplified First Steps:**

To make this beginner-friendly, start by implementing:

1.  **`web-search` tool:** This is relatively self-contained and good for demonstrating tool execution.
2.  **Basic `repo-query` tool (without deep repository context):**  Focus on just passing the user's query to Gemini for general code/programming questions.  Skip the complex repository indexing for now.
3.  **`browser-open` tool:**  Implement a simple `browser-open` tool to open a URL and maybe capture a screenshot.  This will introduce Playwright integration.

Gradually expand to other browser tools and then consider adding more sophisticated repository context features and resources as you progress. Remember to define schemas for all requests and responses as you build out the functionality for type safety and clarity.
