Okay, let's analyze the `cursor-tools` integration description provided and map its features to an MCP server context.

**Cursor-Tools Architecture and Features Analysis for MCP Replication**

`cursor-tools` appears to be a command-line tool designed to provide AI assistance within a coding environment (like Cursor IDE, presumably, given the name). It leverages various AI models and external tools through a set of commands.  The core architecture seems to be a command dispatcher that routes user commands to specific functionalities, interacting with different services (Perplexity, Gemini, GitHub API, Playwright).

Here's a breakdown of `cursor-tools` features and how they can be viewed from an MCP perspective:

**1. Web Search (`cursor-tools web`)**

*   **Functionality:**  Performs web searches using Perplexity AI and returns answers. Can suggest writing output to a file.
*   **Input:**  Search query (string). Options: `--model`, `--max-tokens`, `--save-to`, `--help`.
*   **Output:**  Search results (text, potentially markdown).
*   **Underlying Tech:** Perplexity AI API.
*   **MCP Mapping:**
    *   **MCP Resource:**  Could be modeled as a `web-search-result` resource type.
        *   `list` capability:  Might not be directly applicable.
        *   `read` capability:  Could take a search query as input and return the search results. The URI could be dynamically generated based on the query (e.g., `web-search-result://<query-hash>`).
    *   **MCP Tool:**  Alternatively, or additionally, a `web-search` tool.
        *   `execute` capability: Takes a search query as input and returns the search results.

**2. Repository Context (`cursor-tools repo`)**

*   **Functionality:**  Provides context-aware answers about the current repository using Google Gemini.
*   **Input:**  Question (string). Options: `--model`, `--max-tokens`, `--save-to`, `--help`.
*   **Output:**  Contextual answer (text).
*   **Underlying Tech:** Google Gemini API, likely with repository content indexing.
*   **MCP Mapping:**
    *   **MCP Resource:**  Perhaps a `repository-context` resource.
        *   `read` capability:  Takes a question as input, provides context-aware answer. URI could be generic like `repository-context://current`.
    *   **MCP Tool:**  A `repository-query` tool might be more appropriate.
        *   `execute` capability: Takes a question as input related to the repository, returns an answer.

**3. Documentation Generation (`cursor-tools doc`)**

*   **Functionality:**  Generates documentation for a repository. Supports local and remote (GitHub) repositories.
*   **Input:** Options: `--output`, `--from-github`.
*   **Output:**  Documentation (markdown, potentially other formats if configurable).
*   **Underlying Tech:** Code parsing and documentation generation logic (potentially leveraging AI for summarization and structuring).
*   **MCP Mapping:**
    *   **MCP Tool:**  Definitely a `generate-documentation` tool.
        *   `execute` capability:  Takes repository location (local path or GitHub URL) and output options as input, returns the generated documentation (or a URI to the generated documentation file).

**4. GitHub Information (`cursor-tools github pr`, `cursor-tools github issue`)**

*   **Functionality:**  Retrieves GitHub PRs and issues, either last 10 or specific by number. Supports specifying a repository via `--from-github`.
*   **Input:**  `pr` or `issue` command, optional number, `--from-github` option.
*   **Output:**  PR/Issue details (text, likely formatted).
*   **Underlying Tech:** GitHub API.
*   **MCP Mapping:**
    *   **MCP Resource:** `github-pull-request` and `github-issue` resource types.
        *   `list` capability (for last 10): Returns a list of PR/Issue summaries.
        *   `read` capability (for specific number): Takes PR/Issue number as input, returns detailed information. URI would be like `github-pull-request://<repo>/<pr-number>`.

**5. Browser Automation (`cursor-tools browser open`, `cursor-tools browser act`, `cursor-tools browser observe`, `cursor-tools browser extract`)**

*   **Functionality:**  Automates browser interactions, captures page content, console logs, network activity, and extracts data. Stateless browser instances. Supports actions through natural language instructions and multi-step workflows.
*   **Input:**  URL, instruction (for `act`, `observe`, `extract`), options: `--html`, `--console`, `--network`, `--screenshot`, `--timeout`, `--viewport`, `--headless`, `--no-headless`, `--connect-to`, `--wait`, `--video`.
*   **Output:**  Page content (HTML), console logs, network activity, screenshots, extracted data (depending on the command and options).
*   **Underlying Tech:** Playwright (browser automation library).
*   **MCP Mapping:**
    *   **MCP Tool:**  A suite of browser automation tools.
        *   `browser-open`: `execute` capability, takes URL and options, returns initial browser state (maybe a session ID if state was managed, but `cursor-tools` is stateless, so likely just success/failure).
        *   `browser-act`: `execute` capability, takes URL, instruction string, and options, performs actions and returns the result of actions (maybe updated page content or action success).
        *   `browser-observe`: `execute` capability, takes URL, instruction, and options, returns observed elements and suggested actions.
        *   `browser-extract`: `execute` capability, takes URL, extraction instruction, and options, returns extracted data.
    *   **MCP Resource:**  Less clear if browser automation is a resource. Maybe a `browser-page` resource, but tools seem more fitting for actions.

**General Command Options (`--model`, `--max-tokens`, `--save-to`, `--help`)**

*   **MCP Mapping:** These are likely server-level configurations or request parameters.
    *   `--model`, `--max-tokens`:  Could be request parameters for tools that use AI models.
    *   `--save-to`: Could be a general output handling feature, maybe less directly MCP related, more about client-side behavior.
    *   `--help`:  Server introspection capabilities in MCP could expose command help (though not explicitly defined in MCP spec, server info can be exposed).


**Replicating Cursor-Tools Features in an MCP Server**

To replicate `cursor-tools` functionality in an MCP server, you would need to:

1.  **Choose a Programming Language:** Node.js is a strong choice because the MCP SDK example is in Node.js, and `cursor-tools` likely uses Node.js as well, given the npm commands for installation.

2.  **Use MCP SDK:** Utilize the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (Node.js version) to handle MCP protocol details, message parsing, schema validation, and transport layers.

3.  **Implement Resource and Tool Providers:** For each `cursor-tools` command category, create corresponding MCP resource and/or tool providers.

    *   **Web Search:** Integrate with Perplexity AI API within a `web-search` tool provider. Handle API calls, result formatting, and schema definition for requests (search query) and responses (search results).
    *   **Repository Context:**  Integrate with Google Gemini API within a `repository-query` tool provider. You'll need to handle repository content access and indexing to provide context. This is likely the most complex part, as it requires understanding the repository structure.  Alternatively, you could simplify this initially to just use Gemini for general code-related questions *without* specific repository context, and then enhance it later.
    *   **Documentation Generation:** Implement a `generate-documentation` tool provider. This would involve code parsing (using libraries for different languages), documentation generation logic (potentially using tools like JSDoc for JavaScript, or similar for other languages, or even AI-based documentation summarization), and handling output formatting.
    *   **GitHub Information:** Create `github-pull-request` and `github-issue` resource providers. Use the GitHub API to fetch PR and issue data. Implement `list` and `read` capabilities according to the MCP resource model.
    *   **Browser Automation:** Implement a suite of browser tools (`browser-open`, `browser-act`, `browser-observe`, `browser-extract`).  Integrate with Playwright within these tool providers.  Carefully consider how to manage the stateless nature of `cursor-tools` browser commands in an MCP context.  Each tool execution might start a new Playwright browser instance.

4.  **Define Schemas:**  Crucially, define MCP schemas for all requests and responses for your resources and tools. This ensures type safety and proper data exchange between the client and server, as per MCP best practices.  Look at the schema examples provided in the `mcp-plan.md` for guidance.

5.  **Transport Layer:** Start with `stdio` transport for initial development and testing, as it's simpler.  Later, add HTTP/SSE transport for network accessibility.

6.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling in your resource and tool providers. Return MCP-compliant error responses. Implement logging for debugging and monitoring.

7.  **Documentation for your MCP Server:**  Provide clear documentation for your MCP server, explaining the resources and tools it offers, how to use them, and how to set up and run the server.

**Simplified First Steps (Beginner-Friendly Approach):**

To start simpler, you could initially focus on implementing a subset of `cursor-tools` features as MCP resources and tools. For example:

*   **Start with `stdio` transport.**
*   **Implement the `web-search` tool.** This is relatively self-contained and demonstrates tool execution.
*   **Implement the `github-pull-request` resource (just `list` capability initially).**  This shows resource listing and interaction with an external API.
*   **Skip browser automation and repository context initially**, as these are more complex.
*   **Focus on clear schemas and basic error handling.**

By building these core features first, you can get a working MCP server and gradually expand its capabilities to more closely resemble `cursor-tools`.  Remember to prioritize clear, beginner-friendly design and documentation throughout the development process, as emphasized in the research documents.
