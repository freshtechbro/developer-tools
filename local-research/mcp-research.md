Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: Detailed research on Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture, implementation best practices, and guidelines for generating project artifacts and IDE rules. Include specific details about server design, rule generation, and integration with AI IDEs.
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for communication between LLM applications and external data sources/tools[1][4]. Key aspects of MCP server architecture and implementation include:

Architecture:
- Client-server model with hosts (LLM apps), clients (maintain 1:1 connections), and servers (provide context/tools)[1]
- Protocol layer handles message framing and communication patterns[1]
- Transport layer supports stdio (local) and HTTP/SSE (remote) communication[1]

Claude's MCP Implementation:
- Anthropic implements MCP in Claude through a standardized interface for accessing external tools and context
- Installation is handled through the Claude API client libraries (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Users don't need to install MCP separately - it's built into the Claude SDK
- Claude's implementation focuses on security and validation of tool/context access
- Provides built-in support for common tools like web search, file operations, and code analysis

- Include quick start guides and examples
- Automate dependency installation
- Provide configuration templates
- Include troubleshooting guides

Server implementation:
```javascript
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new Server({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
}, {
  capabilities: {
    resources: {}
  }
});

server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    resources: [
      {
        uri: "example://resource",
        name: "Example Resource"
      }
    ]
  };
});

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

Best practices:
- Use stdio transport for local processes, SSE for remote[1]
- Validate inputs, use type-safe schemas, handle errors gracefully[1]
- Implement timeouts and progress reporting for long operations[1]
- Use TLS for remote connections, validate origins, implement authentication[1]
- Log protocol events, implement health checks, profile performance[1]

For generating project artifacts and IDE rules:
- MCP servers can provide resources (data), tools (actions), and prompts (templates)[4][6]
- Servers expose functionality through endpoints like resources/list, resources/read[6]
- AI IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA use MCP to access project structure and code context[6]

Integration with AI IDEs:
- Implement MCP servers to expose project artifacts, code structure, and IDE functionality[6]
- Use resources to represent files, database records, API responses[6]
- Implement tools for code generation, refactoring, and other IDE actions
- Create prompts for common coding tasks and interactions

Rule generation:
- Define schemas for different artifact types (e.g. code files, models, configs)
- Implement validation logic in MCP server to enforce project rules
- Expose rule checking as MCP tools that can be invoked by AI agents

Example rule implementation:
```javascript
server.setRequestHandler(CheckCodeStyleSchema, async (request) => {
  const { code } = request;
  const violations = linter.checkStyle(code);
  return {
    valid: violations.length === 0,
    violations: violations
  };
});
```
